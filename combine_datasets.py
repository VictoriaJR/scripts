# COMBINE_DATASETS.PY
#
# Given a list of folders, combine the datasets contained in each folder without duplicating sequences.
#
# Input: two or more folders containing gene files. The folders must all be within one folder whose path must be given in the variable inPATH below.
#
# Output: one out file for each gene file; each out file contains all the datasets (from the input folders) with no duplicates. The out files are created in the folder whose path must be given in the variable outPATH below.
#
# NOTE: the code assumes that for a given gene, two repeated organism's sequence ID (or sequence name) have the exact same protein sequence.
#
# EXAMPLE: python combine_datasets.py dataset1/ dataset2/
